    "FEE.org is the website for FEE - a non-profit educational organization.  FEE.org has about 1 million visits per month.\n",

    "For a for-profit organization, success can be measured in terms of products sold, net revenue, profits, etc.\n",
    "For a non-profit with an educational mission, success is more difficult to quantify.  One superficial method is to track the number of people who visit a web page.  However, a visit to a web page does not indicade how engaged the user is with the contect.  We want to know how engaged the user is with the content - did he learn something knew, sign up for more information, or express interest in an offline event?  \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to know things such as - what content causes users to be engaged?  What kinds of content is most likely to trigger important actions?  Furthermore, can we identify groups of users who have similiar behavior patterns?  For example, students researching a papers, experts who want to deepend their knowledge, potential donors, etc."
